# Juniors Spring 2020 Intensive Deliverable Proposal

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** Aucoeur Ngo


**Project Name:** RuPaul's Drag Race Telegram Bot


**Is your project New or Old?** New-ish, it is its own project but will also use and build on my final BEW 1.3 API project


**Is your project Solo or Team?** Solo


## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**

This project will attempt to use the RPDR API created for my final project in BEW 1.3 to make a trivia and GIF bot on the Telegram messenger platform.  Currently, the RPDR API is at MVP stage, so during this intensive, I want to flesh it out more, adding more endpoints and data, which I will connect to the bot to allow for users to query for trivia and also GIFs

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**
Developing a way to organize/sort/tag GIFs for easy lookup
Writing clean, optimized code 
Structuring data for efficiency
Gathering data

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.** 

Create Telegram bot, connect RPDR API to bot and allow basic querying betwen the two.

## Bike
**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use** 

Create more endpoints, add more data to db.  Add basic GIF search functionality (possibly using GIPHY api?)

## Car
**ONE additional feature** 

Build out GIF searching functionality.  Develop a user-submissions/contributions review/approve feature


## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

My goal is to get to Bike stage.  By the end of the intensive, I want to most of the data availabile to be queried and with basic GIF functionality.
